# neovim-coc
This neovim has coc plugin instead of native lsp configured.
And configured in lua programming language.

## why not lsp
cause i was not able not configured it perfectly and
it required extra plugins like of 'snippets', ' autocompletion' and many more.
Coc does not require such thing just install plugins and
do install anything with
```
:CocInstall <extensions>
```

One main thing to like about it ```Coc is easy to configure inplace of lsp```

## installation
Clone this repo first.
```
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek416/nvim-coc.git
```

Copy it to ```.config/nvim/```
open nvim and run ```:PackerSync```

## coc plugin overview
Coc help in same manner that native lsp does
install different language server protocol(Lsp) like VsCode.
