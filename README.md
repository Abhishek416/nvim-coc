# neovim-coc
This neovim has coc plugin instead of native lsp configured.
And configured in lua programming language.

## why not lsp
cause i was not able not configured it perfectly and
it required extra plugins like of 'snippets', ' autocompletion' and many more.
Coc does not require such thing just install plugins and
do install anything with
```
:CocInstall <extensions>
```

One main thing to like about it ```Coc is easy to configure inplace of lsp```
